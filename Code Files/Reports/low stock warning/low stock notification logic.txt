4 tags created (tags a like global variables for the project)

1. "Stock_Warning_Limit" which holds a static number value. currently set to 10

2. "Low_Stock_Check" that returns the result of "select Stock_Quantity from inventory where Stock_Quantity < {[.]Stock_Warning_Limit}"
	if this returns a value it is below 10 stock  

3. "Low_Stock_Alarm" that returns 1 if there is low stock detected above
	whenever this tag changes value another script is called that will open a popup window. 

4. "Low_Stock_Dataset" that just stores "select ItemID,Name,Stock_Quantity from inventory where Stock_Quantity < {[.]Stock_Warning_Limit} " as a dataset that is printed on the popup window
